For example as a to do list to increase productivity. A sort of digital planner to store shopping list or to organize the day. Notes can be put on the home screen as reminders. Each task could be stored in a seperate note or one big todo note could be used.\r\n\r\n** Important **\r\nPlease remember to make a backup copy of notes before formatting a phone or buying a new phone. Since the 1.7.0 version the app will also use phone's device copy, if it's turned on in the device's and the app's settings.\r\n\r\n* Why do I advise to not install the app on an SD card?\r\nI follow the official advice to block installing on an SD card apps that use widgets. This app uses widgets, which are like icons for the notes, and can be placed on a phone's home screen (for example).\r\n\r\nIf you have any additional questions, just contact me by email: notepad.free@outlook.com .\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nArek",
