I've also found transcription to be poor. maybe it is too tuned to an American accent or something but place names and company names rarely work and as a result a lot of context is lost... Also Otty chat is never available/works. Shame because this had a lot of promise",

I figured that I could just try uploading again to receive the summary and other features, only to discover that the audio does not save locally prior to attempting an upload. At this point, I have no idea if there is any way to recover my audio note, as my notes section within the app is empty.",

And sometimes it increases minutes of summary, written of your conversation or meeting. And it has a recorded audio on the top of it. I mean, this app is crazy good. Don't even look for another",

The tool does not work most of the time. If you are recording short session (less than 1/2 hour) it works some of the time. If you sessions are longer (45 minutes and up), it does not work at all. It will record but then fails every time it tries to process the audio. I am now without notes for several important meetings.",

I've used other note keeping apps before, mostly Samsung notes and google keep, but none of them compare to how insanely sleek, customisable and organised Notion is. I love the clean interface, its simple and easy to use, you can create sections within sections within sections making things super organised. its changed the way I use my phone and my brain.

But in the app I always have to manually zoom into 250 as there is no preset zooming option available for numbers like 250. So can you add a feature where we can customly add a preset to the zooming option.",

I almost passed this up because I have other note-taking/meeting apps, but this has unique features that the others don't, so it compliments what I already have nicely. I'm really glad I decided to add this to my tech stack!",

I haven't used it at all - I just saw the bill and was like \"what?\" Tried Google but only got automated responses saying they \"need more information\" without asking any actual questions. Google support seems to be not there - they still have an outdated web page that says they have customer service hours, but there is no human there and even the AI is stuck up and doesn't answer the phone. would u please ref my $40",

Today I decided to check if anything has changed and saw that they are not even mentioning the Windows version on their website now!! No announcement, no explanation. Zero transparency. Never trust such a company. I also cannot access the Android version (there is no confirmation email being sent). So thanks for nothing.",

It crashes every couple minutes, forcing me to take time to restart the app 10-15 times per class, which means the app meant to make it easier to take notes crashes so much that I spend more class time fixing the app than using it. If the lag and repeated crashing issue isn't fixed, I will be moving to something else next semester, subscription or not.",
